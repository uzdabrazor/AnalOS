# Copy resources configuration for Nxtscape build
# This file defines all copy operations for resources during the build process
#
# Conditional Operations:
# - Use 'build_type' field to specify when an operation should run
#   - Supported build types: debug, release, dev, prod
#   - Operations without build_type run for all builds
# - Use 'os' field to specify target operating systems
#   - Supported values: windows, macos, linux (case-sensitive)
#   - Operations without os run for all platforms
# - Use 'arch' field to specify target architectures
#   - Supported values: x64, arm64
#   - Operations without arch run for all architectures
#
